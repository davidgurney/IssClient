# ISSClient
========================

The ISS moves around 28,000 km/h, which is very fast, so you may blink and miss it, but
we want you to create simple application that gets some data about the ISS.

## What we want

We want you to create an application using a PHP framework of your choice that should
able to provide the following.

1. The current position of the ISS (longitude and latitude).
2. Calculate an estimated distance between the current ISS location (latitude/longitude) and a given latitude/longitude (in km).
3. API endpoints for getting the information from tasks 1 and 2.

## The data

Of course you will need to get data from somewhere.Luckily there are API's out there that
can provide you with this basic information.
